# DOGGER (Dogg wrapped bBADGER)

DOGGER is a fork of DOGGSHIT which is a fork of Woofy from YFI.

Inspired by Banteg, It was created during the DOGG DAO Hack-a-thon in order to train non-technical doggs how to launch a smart contract with real value.  It is intended to be forked many times in order to create a fleet of fun furry shitcoins that have some underlying value.

DOGGER is a 1/1000 bBADGER microcoin forked from Woofy.  An additional 1% tax on every token transfer has been added to DOGGER and will be included in all forks belonging to the DAO.  This tax is sent to the multisig of the Council of Guard Dogs.  The Guard Dogs will sell all DOGG coins at frequent intervals for DOGE and BTC.  At the end of each month, all coins will be donated to Dog related charities who accept DOGE.  We already have found one in Chicago.  

It is our hope that if any of our tokens experience real trade volume, a community and proper governance structure will form to focus this giving in other directions, and we look forward to handing over the keys as soon as such a community exists.

You can learn more about our purpose and origins by reading [The DOGG Manifesto](https://app.gitbook.com/@dogg-dao/s/dogg-dao/the-dogg-manifesto-1) and you can join our lively and fun community on [Discord](https://discord.gg/8m5VEDZ5vY)

####All transfers of DOGSHIT and it's and forks are subject to a 1% tax on each transfer.
You can read more about our governance and taxation on our Manifesto, but this money will traded frequently for DOGE or BTC and donated to charity on a monthly basis.



The DOGG ratio of DOGGER is always 1 DOGGER = 1,000 bBADGER. DOGGER is always fully backed by bBADGER.
